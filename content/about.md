M2LInES is an international research program with the goal to improve climate projections and reduce climate model biases, especially at the air-sea interface, using scientific machine learning. Our project will develop interpretable machine learning models to deepen our understanding of complex processes in the climate system. This innovative effort will leverage the availability of big data from high-resolution simulations and data assimilation products with machine learning models to improve the representation of subgrid physics in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere components of existing IPCC-class climate models.
