#### Codes

Our codes are hosted on our Github [repository](https://github.com/m2lines). 

- Code from [Yuval et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091363): 
   * [Neural Network Parametrization](https://github.com/m2lines/Neural_nework_parameterization): code and processed data from simulations and neural network parameterizations used in the manuscript

- Code from [Yuval and O\'Gorman 2021](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10507557.1)
   * [Momentum Parametrization](https://github.com/m2lines/momentum_parameterization): Neural Network Parameterization of subgrid momentum

- Codes from [Guillaumin and Zanna 2021](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002534): 
    * [Subgrid](https://github.com/arthurBarthe/subgrid)
    * [SWE Stochastic Parametrization](https://github.com/m2lines/swe_stochastic_param): Shallow Water Equations on a square basin with stochastic deep learning parameterization of subgrid momentum forcing

Upcoming codes will be linked to this repository as they become available.

#### Datasets

All of the datasets used in MÂ²LInES publications will be made openly available. When possible, they will be hosted on [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)
