#### Codes

Our codes are hosted on our Github [repository](https://github.com/m2lines). 

- Codes from Yuval et al. 2021: 
   * [Neural Network Parametrization](https://github.com/m2lines/Neural_nework_parameterization)
   * [Momentum Parametrization](https://github.com/m2lines/momentum_parameterization): Neural Network Parameterization of subgrid momentum
   * [Subgrid Parametrization](https://github.com/m2lines/subgrid_parameterization): Use of machine learning to achieve stable and accurate simulations of the atmosphere

- Codes from Guillaumin and Zanna 2021: 
    * [Subgrid](https://github.com/arthurBarthe/subgrid)
    * [SWE Stochastic Parametrization](https://github.com/m2lines/swe_stochastic_param): Shallow Water Equations on a square basin with stochastic deep learning parameterization of subgrid momentum forcing

Upcoming codes will be linked to this repository as they become available.

#### Datasets

All of the datasets used in MÂ²LInES publications will be made openly available. When possible, they will be hosted on [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)
