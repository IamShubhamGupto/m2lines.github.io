Despite drastic improvements in climate model development, current simulations have difficulty capturing the interactions among different processes in the atmosphere, oceans, and ice and how they affect the Earth’s climate; this can hinder projections of temperature, rainfall, and sea level.
M²LInES will be focusing on understanding these key climate processes using two types of data:
1. [Data from high-resolution simulation and observations. ](/blog/research4)
2. [Data resulting from model errors, also called data assimilation increments.](/blog/dataassimilation)

Below is a representation of the physical processes that will be studied by the team:
