07/09/2021: The links for applications will be updated as they become available. 

MÂ²LInES affirms the value of differing perspectives in Sciences. As such, we strongly encourage applications from women, racial and ethnic minorities, and other individuals who are under-represented in the profession, across color, creed, race, ethnic and national origin, physical ability, gender and sexual identity, or any other legally protected basis. 

### NYU 

* 1 postdoc in Deep Learning for Climate Science.  [Apply here](https://apply.interfolio.com/89069) 

* 1 postdoc in Air-Sea & Ocean Mesoscale Turbulence Parameterization with Machine Learning. [Apply here](https://apply.interfolio.com/83079) 

### Columbia University


* 1 postdoc / research scientist at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory will be hired to develop data-driven parameterizations for ocean sub-gridscale tracer transport and air-sea interaction, focusing on upper-ocean mesoscale processes.   
  + [Apply at postdoc level](https://pa334.peopleadmin.com/postings/7450) (for candidates with < 2.5 years of postdoc experience)   
  + [Apply at associate research scientist level](https://pa334.peopleadmin.com/postings/7451) (for candidates with > 2.5 years of postdoc experience)   
   

### Princeton University

* 1 postdoc to implement existing machine-learned parameterizations in the MOM6 ocean model and to further develop/implement machine-learned parameterizations of missing processes and model bias in both MOM6 and the sea-ice model SIS2. [Apply here](https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/20861)

### CNRS-IGE
* 1 postdoc in computational oceanography: physics-aware subgrid closures with machine learning. [Apply here](https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Offres/CDD/UMR5001-VALLAN0-059/Default.aspx?lang=EN)


### Future openings:

There will be positions opening later at MIT (on atmospheric deep convection) and CNRS-IPSL (on validation and testing of ocean parameterizations in IPSL climate model).
