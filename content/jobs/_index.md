03/20/2021: The links for applications will be updated as they become available. 

### NYU 

* 3 Postdocs in Machine Learning for climate modelling will be hired to  develop 1) advanced scale- and physics-aware deep learning algorithms;  2) probabilistic deep learning algorithms; 3) interpretable machine learning-based toolkits for physics-discovery. For more info + application: [https://apply.interfolio.com/83078](https://apply.interfolio.com/83078) 

* 1 postdoc in Ocean Mesoscale Processes and Air-sea Coupling will be hired to focus on deepening our understanding of air-sea coupling and mesoscale eddy momentum and energy in the ocean, and their parameterizations via machine learning. Likely to be advertized in the spring/summer 2021. 

### Columbia University

* 1 postdoc, at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, will be hired to develop data-driven parameterizations for ocean sub-gridscale tracer transport and air-sea interaction, focusing on upper-ocean mesoscale processes. Link should appear by early February, email Ryan Abernathey for more info. 

* 1 postdoc, Dept. Of Earth and Environmental Engineering, will be hired to work on the atmospheric boundary layer, with a focus on stable boundary layers and the surface interaction with sea ice and its heterogeneity.  [Apply here](https://findajob.agu.org/job/8014276/postdoc-position-in-stable-boundary-layer-and-machine-learning/?TrackID=26&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=general)

### Princeton University

Apply for any of the following four positions at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/19081.

* 1 postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to develop a parameterization of model bias correction in the context of an ocean data assimilation system.  

* 1 postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to improve the representation of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer for climate model applications.  

* 1 postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to a sea ice data assimilation system with the goal of improving structural errors in a coupled sea ice model.  

* 1 postdoc to implement existing machine-learned parameterizations in the MOM6 ocean model and to further develop/implement machine-learned parameterizations of missing processes and model bias in both MOM6 and the sea-ice model SIS2. 

### NCAR

* 1 postdoc will be hired to work on sea ice and ice-atmosphere interactions. This will include work on characterizing the heterogeneity in sea ice characteristics, including snow and ice thickness, and developing parameterizations of the thermodynamic influence of this heterogeneity. [Apply here](https://ucar.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/UCAR_Careers/job/Mesa-Lab-Building/Postdoctoral-Fellow-I_REQ-2021-21-1)

* 1 postdoc will be hired to analyze atmospheric analysis increments to learn flow-dependent random and systematic errors with emphasis on near-surface processes over the ocean. [Apply here](https://ucar.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/UCAR_Careers/job/Mesa-Lab-Building/Postdoctoral-Fellow-I_REQ-2021-22-1)

### Future openings:

There will be positions opening later at MIT (on atmospheric deep convection), CNRS-IPSL (on validation and testing of ocean parameterizations in IPSL climate model) and CNRS-IGE (on submesoscale parameterizations).
