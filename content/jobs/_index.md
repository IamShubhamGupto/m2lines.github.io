04/06/2021: The links for applications will be updated as they become available. 

MÂ²LInES affirms the value of differing perspectives in Sciences. As such, we strongly encourage applications from women, racial and ethnic minorities, and other individuals who are under-represented in the profession, across color, creed, race, ethnic and national origin, physical ability, gender and sexual identity, or any other legally protected basis. 

### NYU 

* 3 Postdocs in Machine Learning for climate modelling will be hired to  develop 1) advanced scale- and physics-aware deep learning algorithms;  2) probabilistic deep learning algorithms; 3) interpretable machine learning-based toolkits for physics-discovery. For more info + application: [https://apply.interfolio.com/83078](https://apply.interfolio.com/83078) 

* 1 postdoc in Ocean Mesoscale Processes and Air-sea Coupling will be hired to focus on deepening our understanding of air-sea coupling and mesoscale eddy momentum and energy in the ocean, and their parameterizations via machine learning. Likely to be advertized in the Spring/Summer 2021. 

### Columbia University

* 1 postdoc / research scientist at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory will be hired to develop data-driven parameterizations for ocean sub-gridscale tracer transport and air-sea interaction, focusing on upper-ocean mesoscale processes.  
[Apply at postdoc level](https://pa334.peopleadmin.com/postings/7450) (for candidates with < 2.5 years of postdoc experience).  
[Apply at associate research scientist level](https://pa334.peopleadmin.com/postings/7451) (for candidates with > 2.5 years of postdoc experience).  
  
* 1 postdoc, Dept. Of Earth and Environmental Engineering, will be hired to work on the atmospheric boundary layer, with a focus on stable boundary layers and the surface interaction with sea ice and its heterogeneity.  [Apply here](https://findajob.agu.org/job/8014276/postdoc-position-in-stable-boundary-layer-and-machine-learning/?TrackID=26&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=general)

### Princeton University

Apply for any of the following four positions [here](https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/19081).

* 1 postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to develop a parameterization of model bias correction in the context of an ocean data assimilation system.  

* 1 postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to improve the representation of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer for climate model applications.  

* 1 postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to a sea ice data assimilation system with the goal of improving structural errors in a coupled sea ice model.  

* 1 postdoc to implement existing machine-learned parameterizations in the MOM6 ocean model and to further develop/implement machine-learned parameterizations of missing processes and model bias in both MOM6 and the sea-ice model SIS2. 


### Future openings:

There will be positions opening later at MIT (on atmospheric deep convection), CNRS-IPSL (on validation and testing of ocean parameterizations in IPSL climate model) and CNRS-IGE (on submesoscale parameterizations).
