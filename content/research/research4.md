Implementing our machine learning parametrization in climate models to enhance climate projections

New parametrizations will be implemented in ocean models and tested in multiple climate models. 


The aim of the Machine Learning parameterizations for coarse-resolution models will be to achieve comparable accuracy to high-resolution global simulations or observations.
