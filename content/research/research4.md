* Implementing our machine learning parametrization in climate models to enhance climate projections
 - Derive new physics-aware and observation-informed ML tools for subgrid parameterizations and multi-scale analysis of climate-relevant data.
 - Analyze data to improve our understanding of the impact of subgrid processes on surface biases and implement subgrid parameterizations or bias corrections, respectively, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM, CM4, CESM).
 - Assess the mean, variance and extremes of surface temperatures, precipitation, winds and currents, which are crucial diagnostics of the climate system on timescales of days to decades.
