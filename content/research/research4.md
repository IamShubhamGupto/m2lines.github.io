We will diagnose small-scale physical processes such as:

* Atmospheric convection and clouds (O'Gorman, Yuval)
* Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine, Connolly)
* Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Abernathey, Balwada)
* Ocean submesoscale processes (Le Sommer, Gorbunova)
* Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna, Perezhogin)
* Vertical mixing (Adcroft, Reichl, Sane)
* Sea-ice heterogeneity and its influence on air-sea-ice interactions (Holland, Zampieri)
