Development of physics-aware interpretable Machine Learning algorithms for climate processes

Learning from the high resolution data as well as from model errors (Data Assimilation Increments) we will develop Machine Learning algorithms that are "physics aware". 

Our transformative methodology will rely on a range of ML algortithms, including with strict physical constraints or with embeded physics for improved interpretability, and generalizations. 


Those ML models will be used to improve our understanding of subgrid processes surface biases and will be implemented as subgrid parameterizations or as bias corrections, respectively, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM,CM4, CESM).
