* Development of physics-aware interpretable Machine Learning algorithms for climate processes
 
 - We will be using Machine learning algorithm to deriving subgrid parameterizations or bias correction tendencies from coarse-grained HR simulations, and DA increments as well as classification and dimensionality reduction for interpretability. Use of both advanced data-driven deterministic (discriminative) and stochastic (generative) ML models, and the emphasis on physics-aware, interpretable and generalizable subgrid ML models.
 - To aid with interpretability, traditional ML tools such as feature importance, saliency map and heatmaps are used to understand which variables explain the output most and for dimensionality reduction, (nonlinear) principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering are used.
