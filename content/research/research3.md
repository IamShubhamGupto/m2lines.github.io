Learning unaccounted physical processes though existing data assimilation systems 
 
Data assimilation produce a state estimate by merging a short-range dynamical forecast with observations. 

The analysis increment is the difference between the forecasted and corrected model state and thus contains information on the discrepancy between the model and observations. This gives us valuable information on physical processes that are systematically unaccounted for in traditional models. 

Combined with analysis from high resolution simulations, this analysis will improve our understanding and representation of subgrid processes in global climate models, thereby reducing biases and providing more reliable climate projections. 


In particular, in this analysis we will be focusing on:
* Atmospheric processes
* Vertical mixing
* Ocean mesoscale and submesoscale processes
* Sea-ice parametrization
* Air-sea-ice fluxes
