Our machine learning parameterizations will be implemented in coupled climate models from leading modeling centers(NCAR, GFDL, IPSL) to enhance climate projections

The aim of the Machine Learning parameterizations for coarse-resolution models will be to achieve comparable accuracy to high-resolution global simulations or observations.
