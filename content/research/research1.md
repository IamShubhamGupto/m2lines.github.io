Learning physics-aware parameterizations from high-resolution data. 

We will diagnose small-scale physical processes from high-resolution simulations and observational data. Those processes cannot be captured by traditional models, which operate on a bigger scale.
In particular we will be focusing on:


* Atmospheric convection and clouds (O'Gorman)
* Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine)
* Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Abernathey)
* Ocean submesoscale processes (LeSommer)
* Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna)
* Vertical mixing (Adcroft/Reichl)
