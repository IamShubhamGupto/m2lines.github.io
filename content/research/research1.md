Learning physics-aware parameterizations from high-resolution data. 

We will diagnose small-scale physical processes from high-resolution simulations and observational data. Those processes cannot be captured by traditional models, which operate on a bigger scale.
In particular we will be focusing on:


* Boundary layer in the atmosphere
* Mesoscale buoyancy for the ocean (10-100km)
* Sumbesoscale processes (1-10km) for the upper ocean
* Atmospheric convection
* Mesoscale momentum and air-sea interactions
