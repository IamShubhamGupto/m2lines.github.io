* Learning parameterizations from high-resolution models and observational data: 

 - The goal is to drive reduction of intrinsic structural model errors to increase the skill in modelled sea/ice-surface fields on timescales of hours to centuries in global climate models. 
 - Diagnose and reduce the structural error associated with inaccurate numerics and missing/incomplete physics, such as due to small-scale physics
 - Learning from new datasets implementation of climate models with modelling centers, and validation.
 - Remotely sensed observations from ICESat2 and Operation IceBridge (10â€™s m resolution), and surface infrared temperature are being used to characterize heterogeneity in sea ice properties used to define the role of subgrid heterogeneity; satellite altimetry (25 km resolution) is used for surface mesoscale mixing; and Meteosat and GOES-R (ABI) satellite data and CloudSat; EarthCare Doppler CPR (for updraft vertical velocities). In situ data is used for model validation and for estimating bias reduction in the coarser-resolution models with ML parameterizations.
