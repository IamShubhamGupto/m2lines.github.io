We will enhance our understanding of key climate processes using two types of data: 1. Data from high-resolution simulation and observations. 2. Data resulting from model errors, also called data assimilation increments.    
  
##### From high-resolution simulations and observational data
We will diagnose small-scale physical processes such as:


* Atmospheric convection and clouds (O'Gorman)
* Atmospheric boundary layer processes at the ocean and sea-ice interface (Gentine)
* Ocean mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (Abernathey)
* Ocean submesoscale processes (LeSommer)
* Ocean mesoscale momentum, energy and air-sea interactions (Zanna)
* Vertical mixing (Adcroft/Reichl)
* Sea-ice heterogeneity and its influence on air-sea-ice interactions (Holland)

##### We will also learn from the data resulting from model errors. 

###### In particular, in this analysis we will be focusing on:

* Atmospheric processes
* Vertical mixing
* Ocean mesoscale and submesoscale processes
* Sea-ice parametrization
* Air-sea-ice fluxes
