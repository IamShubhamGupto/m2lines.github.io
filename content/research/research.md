Our research themes are

* Physics-aware interpretable Machine Learning Models for climate processes 

* Learning physics-aware parameterizations from high-resolution models and observational data 
			
* Learning structural uncertainty though existing data assimilation systems

* Improving existing climate models and climate projections with machine learning parameterizations
