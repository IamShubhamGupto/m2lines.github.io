## Project Goal

 Scientists rely on computer simulations - or **climate models** - to describe the complex evolution of atmosphere, ocean, and ice systems. These climate models break the components of the climate system into a series of **grid boxes** to imitate how the ocean, atmosphere, and ice are changing and interact with each other. The issue is that the number of grid boxes selected is **limited by computer power**. Currently, climate models for multi-decade projections use grid box sizes measuring approximately 50 km to 100 km (roughly 30 to 60 miles). As a result, physical processes that occur on **scales that are smaller than the grid box** (e.g., clouds, turbulence, and ocean mixing) of climate models are not well captured.    

The **M²LInES** initiative is using the wealth of newly available datasets and **machine learning** to deepen our understanding and better capture these unaccounted physical processes. These machine learning models will guide physics-discovery and help reduce the imprecision of existing climate simulations by **providing high-resolution dynamics from low-resolution observables**.  

  
M²LInES will be focusing on processes happening in the ocean, atmosphere and sea-ice. Below is a representation of the physical processes that will be studied by the team:
