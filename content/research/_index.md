## Project Goal

##### Scientists rely on computer simulations - or **climate models** - to describe the evolution of atmosphere, ocean, and ice systems due to their complexity. These climate models separate the climate system into a series of **grid boxes** to imitate how the ocean, atmosphere, and ice are changing and interact with each other. The issue is that the number of grid boxes selected is **limited by computer power**. Currently, climate models for multi-decade projections use grid box sizes measuring approximately 50 km to 100 km (roughly 30 to 60 miles). As a result, processes that occur on **scales that are smaller than the grid box** (clouds, turbulence, and ocean mixing) are in turn not well captured.  

##### The **MÂ²LInES** initiative is using **machine learning** to better capture these unaccounted physical processes. Not only will these algorithms reduce the imprecision of existing models by **providing high-resolution dynamics from low-resolution measurements**, they will be use to **deepen our understanding** and even **discover** new physical processes that happen on **subgrid** levels.
