Deficiencies in how upper ocean mixing is modeled cause biases in climate simulations, affecting ocean heat uptake and ENSO predictions. To address this, researchers evaluated different mixing models, To address this, researchers evaluated different mixing models, in this [study](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170785794.47537760/v1) led by **Brandon Reichl**, using detailed simulations and applied improvements to NOAA/GFDL's OM4 ocean model. Enhancements to the model's mixing were informed by observational data and led to more accurate diurnal mixing, ocean currents, and upper ocean temperature profiles. The improved model better represents tropical ocean dynamics, leading to more accurate climate predictions. **Alistair Adcroft** also contributed to the research.
