Several of MÂ²LInES members and affiliates (**Bhouri, Gentine, Zanna, Abernathey, Busecke, Mooers, Shamekh,** and **Yuval**) have contributed to this [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu) paper presenting ClimSim, the largest-ever dataset designed for hybrid ML-physics research. It comprises multi-scale climate simulations, global in coverage, spans multiple years at high sampling frequency, and is designed such that resulting emulators are compatible with downstream coupling into operational climate simulators. The [data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEAP/ClimSim_high-res) and [code](https://leap-stc.github.io/ClimSim/README.html) are open access.
