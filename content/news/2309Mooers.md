**Griffin Mooers** is lead author in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01613) that leverages Variational Autoencoders on SPCAM5 output to examine the changes in the upper quantiles of precipitation between a control and warmed simulation. They find intense precipitation changes are mostly controlled by spatial shifts in deep convection.
