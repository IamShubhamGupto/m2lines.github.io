In this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10231), **Mohamed Aziz Bhouri** and co-authors, including **Pierre Gentine**, developed a probabilistic multi-fidelity atmospheric parameterization for heat and moisture tendency. They implemented it on CESM CAM5 and SPCAM5 data and showed its capabilities to well extrapolate to unseen warmer climate simulations while returning trustworthy uncertainty quantification.
