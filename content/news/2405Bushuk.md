This [study](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/aop/BAMS-D-23-0163.1/BAMS-D-23-0163.1.xml), led by **Mitch Bushuk**, provides a comparison of September Arctic sea ice seasonal prediction skill across a diverse set of 34 dynamical and statistical prediction models, quantifying the state-of-the-art in the rapidly growing sea ice prediction research community. The authors find that both dynamical and statistical prediction models can skillfully predict September Arctic sea ice 0â€“3 months in advance on Pan-Arctic, regional, and local spatial scales. These results demonstrate that there are bright prospects for skillful operational seasonal predictions of Arctic sea ice and highlight a number of crucial prediction system design aspects to guide future improvements.
