Forty-two international researchers, including Lorenzo Zampieri, were invited to Gwangmyeong (South Korea) to discuss recent advances in sea ice modelling to help guide the development of a state-of-the-art Korean sea ice modelling program under the leadership of the Korean Polar Research Institute (KOPRI). The workshop produced a [report](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/105/3/BAMS-D-23-0332.1.xml), which highlights 1) the opportunity to use AI techniques in support of various sea ice modelling tasks both for short-term and climate predictions and 2) the need for strengthened collaborations among international groups to connect existing “research bubbles” and facilitate the dissemination of ideas.
