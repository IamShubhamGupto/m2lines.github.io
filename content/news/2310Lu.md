This [study](https://essopenarchive.org/users/639046/articles/661055-unetkf-ensemble-u-net-kalman-filter) by **Feiyu Lu** incorporates deep learning methods to compliment and improve the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation algorithm. More specifically, a convolutional neural network is trained to predict the error statistics of a model ensemble, which will reduce the computational costs of the ensemble Kalman filter. This approach is tested in a quasi-geostrophic dynamic model to demonstrate its feasibility in more advanced weather and climate applications.
