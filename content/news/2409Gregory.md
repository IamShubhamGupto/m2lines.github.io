In this [study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51900-x), **Will Gregory** and co-authors **developed an open-source Python library for interpolating sparse altimetry data**, using local Gaussian process models. The library allows them to generate full images of daily sea ice fields at high spatial resolution (5 km), which they hypothesize could be used to train ML models for sub-grid scale parameterizations.
