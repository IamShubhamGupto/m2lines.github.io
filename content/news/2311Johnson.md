[OceanBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15599) is a suite of tools for designing experiments relevant to the oceanography community like interpolation, forecasting and estimation. Lead author **J. Emmanuel Johnson** and co-authors, including **Anastasiia Gorbunova** and **Julien Le Sommer**, demonstrate its use within a benchmark setting for sea surface height interpolation, using general circulation model simulations and real satellite observations.
