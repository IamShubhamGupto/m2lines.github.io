Climate models show varied predictions for the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) this century. Researchers, including **Laure Zanna** and CliMA members, reduced this uncertainty by linking AMOC strength to the meridional density difference and overturning depth. They found that models with a deeper present-day overturning predict greater weakening due to less stratified North Atlantic waters. Using observational data, they estimate a modest AMOC weakening of about 4 Sv by century's end, regardless of emissions. The [study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4456168/v1) highlights that inaccuracies in current ocean stratification models lead to exaggerated predictions of AMOC weakening.
