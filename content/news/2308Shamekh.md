This [preprint](https://essopenarchive.org/users/553025/articles/649735-learning-atmospheric-boundary-layer-turbulence), by Sara Shamekh and Pierre Gentine, proposes a novel data-driven parameterization of vertical turbulent fluxes in convective boundary layer, that models the fluxes of various scalars across turbulent regimes. By incorporating a physics-based constraint this approach allows us to decompose the total vertical flux into two main modes of variability based on large scale  forces that control the turbulence in the atmosphere.
