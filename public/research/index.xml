      <description>Learning parameterizations from high-resolution models and observational data:   The goal is to drive reduction of intrinsic structural model errors to increase the skill in modelled sea/ice-surface fields on timescales of hours to centuries in global climate models. Diagnose and reduce the structural error associated with inaccurate numerics and missing/incomplete physics, such as due to small-scale physics Learning from new datasets implementation of climate models with modelling centers, and validation.</description>

      <description>Development of physics-aware interpretable Machine Learning algorithms for climate processes   We will be using Machine learning algorithm to deriving subgrid parameterizations or bias correction tendencies from coarse-grained HR simulations, and DA increments as well as classification and dimensionality reduction for interpretability. Use of both advanced data-driven deterministic (discriminative) and stochastic (generative) ML models, and the emphasis on physics-aware, interpretable and generalizable subgrid ML models. To aid with interpretability, traditional ML tools such as feature importance, saliency map and heatmaps are used to understand which variables explain the output most and for dimensionality reduction, (nonlinear) principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering are used.</description>

      <description>Implementing our machine learning parametrization in climate models to enhance climate projections   Derive new physics-aware and observation-informed ML tools for subgrid parameterizations and multi-scale analysis of climate-relevant data. Analyze data to improve our understanding of the impact of subgrid processes on surface biases and implement subgrid parameterizations or bias corrections, respectively, in coarser resolution ocean (NEMO and MOM6) and coupled climate models (IPSLCM, CM4, CESM). Assess the mean, variance and extremes of surface temperatures, precipitation, winds and currents, which are crucial diagnostics of the climate system on timescales of days to decades.</description>
